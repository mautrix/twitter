# v0.2.1 (2025-01-16)

* Fixed various bugs.

# v0.2.0 (2024-12-16)

* Rewrote bridge in Go using bridgev2 architecture.
  * To migrate the bridge, simply upgrade in-place. The database and config
    will be migrated automatically, although some parts of the config aren't
    migrated (e.g. log config).
  * It is recommended to check the config file after upgrading. If you have
    prevented the bridge from writing to the config, you should update it
    manually.
